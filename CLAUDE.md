# Working on Gahturiyu Sim

Laz is the designer; Claude writes the code. He playtests on a Windows desktop
and tweaks through conversation, not an editor. Explain game-dev terms plainly.
World lore (races, languages, architecture, pantheon) lives in the claude.ai
"Gahturiyu" Project, not in this repo.

## Rules that keep the bands honest

These are load-bearing. `tests/consistency.rs` enforces the first three.

1. **Outcomes never depend on band, step size, or squad position.** Bands decide
   how *often* something is looked at and how much *detail* exists — never
   *what happens*. If you add a system where the far band resolves something
   differently (e.g. strength-vs-strength fights), the band-1 version must be
   the same event at higher resolution, and the result must be reconciled back
   into the summary numbers.
2. **Randomness is keyed by what is decided, not when code runs.** Use
   `Rng::from_keys(&[world seed, entity, hour/leg/etc, tag])`. Never draw from a
   shared running RNG inside the step loop.
3. **Movement is scheduled, not integrated.** Groups carry legs with absolute
   depart/arrive times; position is looked up. Don't add per-tick velocity.
4. **Details, once built, are permanent.** `Person::ensure_detail` builds from the
   seed and the cached `might`; never rebuild or reroll an existing detail.
5. **`might` changes only via `recompute_might()`**, called when gear or traits change.
6. **`src/sim` has no graphics dependency.** The window reads the sim and sends
   orders (`order_squad`); it never contains world rules.

## Verifying visual changes

The window can screenshot itself headlessly:

```
GAHT_SHOT=out.png GAHT_FRAMES=200 GAHT_SPEED=4 GAHT_ZOOM=0.05 \
  xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1600x1000x24" ./target/release/gahturiyu
```

`GAHT_HOVER=x,y` fakes the mouse to check tooltips.

## Canon notes used so far

- Races coexist Elder Scrolls style: every town is mixed; race tilts trait
  averages with a wide spread per person.
- Horaro live on stilts just off any coast, so every coastal town depends on them.
- Ṭaḍoro don't found towns; they lodge in others' towns or wander.
- The south-east inland is Qotiro country; elsewhere inland is mostly Roduro.
- Population is 5,000 split evenly by race (a starting point, Laz's call).
